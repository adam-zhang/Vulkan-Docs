vkCmdSetViewport(3)
===================

Name
----
vkCmdSetViewport - Set the viewport on a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetViewport.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:viewportCount::
    The number of viewport rectangles to set.

pname:pViewports::
    A pointer to an array of structures describing the viewports.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetViewport sets the dynamic viewport state for the command buffer
specified in pname:commandBuffer. pname:viewportCount is the number of viewports
to update and pname:pViewports is a pointer to an array of slink:VkViewport
structures describing the new viewport state. The definition of slink:VkViewport
is:

include::../structs/VkViewport.txt[]

The pname:x and pname:y members of slink:VkViewport specifies the
upper left corner of the viewport rectangle, in pixels. The pname:width
and pname:height parameters specify the size of the rectangle, and are also
expressed in pixels. The pname:minDepth and pname:maxDepth members specify the
depth range for the viewport.

The viewports numbered zero through pname:viewportCount are updated and any
remaining viewports become undefined.

The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the origins and extents of the viewports are taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change them using fname:vkCmdSetViewport results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current values of the viewport rectangle
origins and extents become undefined and must be set using a call to
fname:vkCmdSetViewport.
