vkCmdPushConstants(3)
=====================

Name
----
vkCmdPushConstants - Update the values of push constants.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdPushConstants.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    A handle to the command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:layout::
    A handle to the pipeline layout describing the layout of the push constants.

pname:stageFlags::
    A bitmask specifying the pipeline stages for which to update push constants.

pname:offset::
    The offset of the first push constant to update in the layout.

pname:size::
    The size of the push constants to update.

pname:pValues::
    A pointer to a region of memory containing the new values for the push constants.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdPushConstants updates the values of push constants for the command buffer
specified by pname:commandBuffer. Push constants become visible to the next drawing or
dispatch command appended to pname:commandBuffer. pname:layout specifies a handle to
a pipeline layout object containing the layout information for the push constants.
pname:stageFlags specifies the pipeline stages for which the push constant update
is to be applied. This parameter is a bitwise combination of members of the
elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits enumeration and must match the shader stages used
in the pipeline layout for the range specified by pname:offset and pname:size.
The definition of elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits is:

pname:offset and pname:size specify the offset of the start of the region to be updated
and its size, respectively. Both are in units of bytes.

pname:pValues is a pointer to a region of pname:size bytes of memory containing the
new values for the specified push constants.
