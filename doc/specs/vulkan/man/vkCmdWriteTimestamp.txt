vkCmdWriteTimestamp(3)
=======================

Name
----
vkCmdWriteTimestamp - Write a device timestamp into a query object.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdWriteTimestamp.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which the command will be placed.

pname:pipelineStage::
    The stage of the pipeline at which the timestamp will be written.

pname:queryPool::
    A handle to the query pool object containing the query.

pname:entry::
    The entry in the query pool at which to write the query.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdWriteTimestamp places a command into the command buffer specified
by pname:commandBuffer which, when executed, will cause the GPU to write its
internal timestamp into the query pool specified by pname:queryPool at the
entry specified in pname:entry. The timestamp is written when the command
passes the pipeline stage specified by pname:pipelineStage. The pipeline
stage is a single member of the elink:VkPipelineStageFlagBits enumeration,
the definition of which is:

If an implementation is not capable of writing a timestamp value at the
pipeline point specified, it may at its option write the timestamp at
any point appearing later in the logical pipeline. However, it must do
this consistently for similar pipeline configurations.
