vkDestroyImage - Destroy an image object

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyImage.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:image::
    The handle of the object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyImage destroys the image object whose handle is specified in
pname:image. pname:image must be a valid handle to an image object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateImage on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After an image has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again. Additionally, views of
images immediately become invalid once the parent image has been destroyed.
