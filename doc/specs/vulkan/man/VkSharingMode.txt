VkSharingMode(3)
================

Name
----
VkSharingMode - Specifies the mode of resource sharing.

C Specification
---------------

include::../enums/VkSharingMode.txt[]

Constants
---------

ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE::
    Objects created using this sharing mode can only be accessed by queues
    of the same queue family at any given time.

ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT::
    Objects created using this sharing mode can be accessed by queues from
    different queue families simultaneously.

Description
-----------

The constants of this enumeration are used to specify the intended resource
sharing mode used by a buffer or image object.

Buffers and images created using ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE can only
be accessed by queues of the same queue family at any given time. Before
being able to access the object using a queue from a different queue family
the application has to transfer exclusive ownership of the object between
the source and destination queue families. In order to do that the
application has to perform the following operations:

1. Release exclusive ownership from the source queue family to the destination queue family.

2. Use semaphores to ensure proper execution control for the ownership transfer.

3. Acquire exclusive ownership for the destination queue family from the source queue family.

To release exclusive ownership the application should execute an image
memory barrier (see slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier) on a queue from the source
queue family where it must set the ptext:srcQueueFamilyIndex parameter of
the barrier to the source queue family's index, and the
ptext:dstQueueFamilyIndex parameter of the barrier to the destination queue
family's index.

To acquire exclusive ownership the application should execute the same image
memory barrier on a queue from the destination queue family.

Buffers and images created using ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT can be
simultaneously accessed by queues from different queue families. Accesses of
buffers and images created using this sharing mode may have lower performance
characteristics.
