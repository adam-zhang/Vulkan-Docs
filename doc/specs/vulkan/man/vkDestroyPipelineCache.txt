C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyPipelineCache.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:pipelineCache::
    The handle of the object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyPipelineCache destroys the pipeline cache object whose handle is specified in
pname:pipelineCache, which must be a valid handle to a pipeline cache object that was created
by a successful call to flink:vkCreatePipelineCache on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a pipeline cache has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and should not be accessed again.
