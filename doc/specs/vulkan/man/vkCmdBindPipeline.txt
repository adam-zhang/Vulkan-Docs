vkCmdBindPipeline(3)
=====================

Name
----
vkCmdBindPipeline - Bind a pipeline object to a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdBindPipeline.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer to which to bind the pipeline.

pname:pipelineBindPoint::
    The pipeline bind point on the command buffer to which to bind the pipeline.

pname:pipeline::
    The pipeline object to bind to pname:commandBuffer.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdBindPipeline binds the pipeline object specified in pname:pipeline to the command buffer
specified in pname:commandBuffer at the bind point specified by pname:pipelineBindPoint. The value of
pname:pipelineBindPoint must be supported by the command buffer, and be valid for the specified
pipeline object. pname:pipelineBindPoint may be one of ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE or
ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, assuming the command buffer supports the corresponding
bind point. All work subsequently issued in pname:commandBuffer will use the pipeline bound to the
corresponding pipeline bind point.

-----

Although fname:vkCmdBindPipeline does not generate errors or return a value, enabled
validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
