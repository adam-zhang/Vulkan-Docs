vkCmdSetDepthBias(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdSetDepthBias - Set the depth bias dynamic state.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetDepthBias.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    A handle to the command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:depthBiasConstantFactor::
    The constant bias factor.

pname:depthBiasClamp::
    The bias clamp factor.

pname:depthBiasSlopeFactor::
    The bias slope factor.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetDepthBias sets the depth bias parameters for the command buffer specified
by pname:commandBuffer. The pname:depthBiasConstantFactor, pname:depthBiasClamp
and pname:depthBiasSlopeFactor parameters specify the new values for the depth
bias calculation. The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the values of the depth bias parameters are taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change them using fname:vkCmdSetBlendConstants results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current values of the depth bias parameters become undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetDepthBias.
