=====================

Name

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkResetCommandPool.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    The device the command pool was created from.

pname:commandPool::
    Command pool to reset.

pname:flags::
    Flags controlling the behavior of the Reset operation. For more details,
    see elink:VkCmdPoolResetFlags.

Description
-----------

fname:vkResetCommandPool resets the command pool specified in pname:commandPool to a
state that depends on the pname:flags. If pname:flags includes
ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT, then the pool's memory is returned
to the system. If ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT is not used, then the
pool's memory is return to an "unallocated" state which command buffers can allocate
from.

Resetting a pool implicitly resets all command buffers that were created from it, where
resetting the command buffers is treated as if ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT
were used.
