Name
----
VkBufferUsageFlags - Buffer object usage flags.

C Specification
---------------

include::../flags/VkBufferUsageFlags.txt[]

Constants
---------

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT::
    The buffer can be used as the source operand of transfer operations (flink:vkCmdCopyBuffer,
    flink:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage).

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT::
    The buffer can be used as the destination operand of transfer operations (flink:vkCmdCopyBuffer,
    flink:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer, flink:vkCmdUpdateBuffer, flink:vkCmdFillBuffer, flink:vkCmdWriteTimestamp,
    flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults).

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer supports reads via uniform texel buffer descriptors.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer supports loads, stores, and atomic operations via storage texel buffer descriptors.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer supports reads via uniform buffer descriptors.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer supports loads, stores, and atomic operations via storage buffer descriptors.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDEX_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer can be bound as an index buffer using the flink:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer command.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer can be bound as a vertex buffer using the flink:vkCmdBindVertexBuffers command.

ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDIRECT_BUFFER_BIT::
    The buffer can be used as the source of indirect commands (flink:vkCmdDrawIndirect,
    flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect, flink:vkCmdDispatchIndirect).

Description
-----------

These flags are used in the slink:VkBufferCreateInfo structure passed as
parameter to flink:vkCreateBuffer to define the intended use of the created
buffer. Trying to use the buffer for any other purpose than those requested
at creation time may result in undefined behavior.
