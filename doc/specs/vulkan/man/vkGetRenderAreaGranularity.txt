vkGetRenderAreaGranularity(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkGetRenderAreaGranularity - Returns the granularity for optimal render area.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetRenderAreaGranularity.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    The device in which pname:renderPass was created.

pname:renderPass::
    The render pass for which to query the render area granularity.

pname:pGranularity::
    A pointer to a structure containing the return value.

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetRenderAreaGranularity returns the granularity at which the ptext:renderArea member of the
slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure should be for optimal performance. pname:device
must be the device which created pname:renderPass. The pname:renderPass
parameter must be the same as the one given in the slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure for which
the render area is relevant. pname:pGranularity must point to an instance of the slink:VkExtent2D
structure, which will be filled if fname:vkGetRenderAreaGranularity is successful. The definitions
of the slink:VkExtent2D structure is:

include::../structs/VkExtent2D.txt[]

The conditions leading to an optimal ptext:renderArea are:

* the ptext:offset.x member of ptext:renderArea must be a multiple of the pname:width member of
  the returned slink:VkExtent2D (the horizontal granularity).

* the ptext:offset.y member of ptext:renderArea must be a multiple of the pname:height of the
  returned slink:VkExtent2D (the vertical granularity).

* it must be true that either the ptext:offset.width member of ptext:renderArea is a multiple of the
  horizontal granularity or that ptext:offset.x + ptext:offset.width is equal to the
  pname:width of the ptext:framebuffer in the slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo.

* it must be true that either the ptext:offset.height member of ptext:renderArea is a multiple of the
  vertical granularity or that ptext:offset.y + ptext:offset.height is equal to the
  pname:height of the ptext:framebuffer in the slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo.
