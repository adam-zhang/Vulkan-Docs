vkCmdNextSubpass(3)
===================

Name
----
vkCmdNextSubpass - Transition to the next subpass of a render pass.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdNextSubpass.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer in which to switch to the next subpass.

pname:contents::
       A description of how the commands for the next subpass will be issued.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdNextSubpass finalizes the previous subpass of the current render pass
and prepares for the next subpass. It may only be called in a primary command
buffer when a render pass is active. For a render pass with N subpasses,
fname:vkCmdNextSubpass must be used exactly N-1 times between
fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass and fname:vkCmdEndRenderPass to transition through all
of the subpasses.

The pname:contents parameter describes how the commands in the next subpass will be
provided. If it is ename:VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_INLINE, the contents of the
subpass will be recorded inline in the primary command buffer, and calling a
secondary command buffer within the subpass is an error. If pname:contents
is ename:VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS, the contents are
recorded in secondary command buffers that will be called from the primary
command buffer, and fname:vkCmdExecuteCommands is the only valid command on
the command buffer until fname:vkCmdNextSubpass or fname:vkCmdEndRenderPass.

Transitioning between subpasses performs any multisample resolve operations in
the pass being ended, and transitions attachment images from their current
layout to the layout required by the next subpass.
