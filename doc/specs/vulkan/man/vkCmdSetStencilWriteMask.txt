vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask(3)
===========================

Name
----
vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask - Set the stencil write mask dynamic state.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:faceMask::
    The face or faces to which the new mask is to apply.


pname:writeMask::
    The new value to use for the stencil compare mask.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask sets the mask value used for stencil writes
on the command buffer specified by pname:commandBuffer to pname:writeMask. pname:faceMask specifies the
face or faces to which the new values are applied. It a bitmask comprised of members
of the elink:VkStencilFaceFlagBits enumeration, the definition of which is:

include::../enums/VkStencilFaceFlagBits.txt[]

The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the value of the stencil write mask is taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change it using fname:vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK dynamic
state enabled is bound, the current value of the stencil write mask becomes undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask.

If the stencil test is disabled in the current graphics pipeline, then the value of
the stencil write mask is ignored.
