fname:vkCreateCommandPool creates a new command pool object using pname:device and places
its handle in the variable whose address is given in pname:pCommandPool. pname:pCreateInfo is
a pointer to an instance of the slink:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure which contains
information about how to create the new command pool. Its definition is:

include::../structs/VkCommandPoolCreateInfo.txt[]

pname:queueFamilyIndex indicates the family of queues which the command buffer can be
submitted to, as well as the subset of commands which may be recorded on it.

pname:flags is a bitfield of flags indicating usage behavior for the pool and command
buffers allocated from it. Possible values include:

ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT indicates that command buffers created from the
pool will be short-lived, meaning that they will be reset or destroyed in a relatively
short timeframe.

ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT controls whether it is legal to call
fname:vkResetCommandBuffer on a command buffer allocated from the pool. If this is not
set, then the command buffers may only be reset in bulk by calling
fname:vkResetCommandPool.
