vkDestroyDescriptorPool(3)
==========================

Name
----
vkDestroyDescriptorPool - Destroy a descriptor pool object

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyDescriptorPool.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:descriptorPool::
    The handle of the descriptor pool to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyDescriptorPool destroys the descriptor pool object whose handle is specified in
pname:descriptorPool. pname:descriptorPool must be a valid handle to descriptor pool object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateDescriptorPool on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a descriptor pool object has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again.

Any descriptor sets allocated from the pool should be freed before the pool is destroyed. Not returning
descriptor sets to the pool before destroying the pool may cause a resource leak.
