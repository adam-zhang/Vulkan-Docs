====================

Name

vkGetFenceStatus - Return the status of a fence.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetFenceStatus.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns pname:fence.

pname:fence::
    The fence whose status to return.

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetFenceStatus returns the immediate status of the fence whose handle is given in pname:fence.
Fences are initially created in the unsignaled state and are associated with submissions to queues
through a call to flink:vkQueueSubmit. Fences are signaled by the system when work invoked by
flink:vkQueueSubmit completes. Fences may subsequently be reset by calling flink:vkResetFences.
To wait for one or more fences to become signaled, it is recommended that flink:vkWaitForFences
be used in preference to repeatedly polling flink:vkGetFenceStatus.

which may be one of:

* ename:VK_SUCCESS indicates that the fence has completed (its status
  is signaled).
* ename:VK_NOT_READY indicates that the fence has not yet completed (its status
  is unsignaled).

Upon failure, a descriptive error code is returned.
