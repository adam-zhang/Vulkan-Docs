vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask - Set the stencil compare mask dynamic state.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:faceMask::
    The face or faces to which the new mask is to apply.

pname:compareMask::
    The new value to use for the stencil compare mask.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask sets the mask value used for stencil comparisons
on the command buffer specified by pname:commandBuffer. pname:faceMask specifies the
face or faces to which the new values are applied. It a bitmask comprised of members
of the elink:VkStencilFaceFlagBits enumeration, the definition of which is:

include::../enums/VkStencilFaceFlagBits.txt[]

The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the value if the stencil compare mask is taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change it using fname:vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK dynamic
state enabled is bound, the current value of the stencil compare mask becomes undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask.

If the stencil test is disabled in the current graphics pipeline, then the value of
the stencil compare mask is ignored.
