vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties(3)
=========================================

Name
----
vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties - Returns properties of available physical device extensions.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:physicalDevice::
    Physical device to query.

pname:pLayerName::
    Optional layer name to query.

pname:pPropertyCount::
    Count indicating number of sname:VkExtensionProperties pointed to by
    pname:pProperties.

pname:pProperties::
    Pointer to an array of sname:VkExtensionProperties.

Description
-----------

fname:vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties retrieves properties for
extensions on a physical device whose handle is given in
pname:physicalDevice. To determine the extensions implemented by a layer set
pname:pLayerName to point to the layer's name and any returned extensions
are implemented by that layer. Setting pname:pLayerName to NULL will return
the available non-layer extensions. pname:pPropertyCount must be set to the
size of the VkExtensionProperties array pointed to by pname:pProperties. The
pname:pProperties should point to an array of VkExtensionProperties to be
filled out or null. If null, fname:vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties will
update pPropertyCount with the number of extensions found. The definition of
slink:VkExtensionProperties is as follows:
