============================

Name
----
vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults - Copy the results of queries in a query pool to a buffer object.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which the command is to be placed.

pname:queryPool::
    The query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:startQuery::
    The index of the first query in the query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:queryCount::
    The number of queries in the query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:dstBuffer::
    The buffer object the results should be written to.

pname:dstOffset::
    The offset within the buffer object the results should be written to.

pname:stride::
    The stride between subsequent query result writes.

pname:flags::
    The flags controlling the behavior of the query result copy command (see elink:VkQueryResultFlags).

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults copies the results of pname:queryCount number of
queries in the query pool specified by pname:queryPool starting from index
pname:startQuery. The results are written to the buffer object specified by
pname:dstBuffer starting from pname:dstOffset with each subsequent query's
result being written pname:stride number of bytes after the previous one. The
semantics of when and what values written to the destination buffer are defined
by the type of the queries in the query pool, the query control flags passed
to flink:vkCmdBeginQuery, and the query result control flags specified by pname:flags.

validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
