vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect(3)
============================

Name
----
vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect - Perform an indexed indirect draw.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer upon which to execute the command.

pname:buffer::
    The buffer from which to source the indirect draw parameters.

pname:offset::
    The offset within the buffer where the draw parameters are located.

pname:drawCount::
    The number of draws to issue.

pname:stride::
    The stride between each structure member.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect issues an indirect indexed draw list
containing pname:drawCount draws into the command buffer specified in
pname:commandBuffer. pname:buffer is the buffer containing the drawing
parameters, which begin at pname:offset bytes into the buffer. Each command
is an instance of a slink:VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand structure, separated by
pname:stride bytes in memory. If pname:stride is zero, then the array is
assumed to be tightly packed. The definition of
slink:VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand is as follows.

include::../structs/VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand.txt[]

The members of sname:VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand are interpreted in the
same fashion as the similarly named parameters of flink:vkCmdDrawIndexed.
pname:offset and pname:stride should be multiples of four.

Notes
-----

Although fname:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect does not generate errors or return a value, enabled
validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
