Name
----
vkDestroyDevice - Destroy a logical device.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyDevice.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the logical device to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyDevice destroys a logical device. It does not destroy any resources created
by or associated with the device. If those resources are not destroyed, they may be leaked.
Therefore, applications should ensure that all objects created through the logical device
have been destroyed before destroying the device itself. Attempts to destroy code:VK_NULL_HANDLE
are silently ignored.
