vkGetQueryPoolResults(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkGetQueryPoolResults - Copy results of queries in a query pool to a host memory region.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetQueryPoolResults.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device owning the query pool.

pname:queryPool::
    The query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:startQuery::
    The index of the first query in the query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:queryCount::
    The number of queries in the query pool whose results should be copied to the buffer object.

pname:dataSize::
    The size of the data area pointed to by pname:pData.

pname:pData::
    A pointer to a buffer that will be filled with query results.

pname:stride::
    The stride, in bytes between the start of each query object in memory.

pname:flags::
    The flags controlling the behavior of the query result copy command (see elink:VkQueryResultFlags).

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetQueryPoolResults copies the results of pname:queryCount number of queries in the query pool specified
by pname:queryPool starting from index pname:startQuery. The results are written to the host memory buffer specified
by pname:pData. pname:dataSize contains the size of the output buffer. If pname:pData is not code:NULL,
then the output buffer size must be large enough to hold the query results. The semantics of when and what values
written to the destination buffer are defined by the type of the queries in the query pool, the query control
flags passed to flink:vkCmdBeginQuery, and the query result control flags specified by pname:flags.

Return Value
------------

Upon success, fname:vkGetQueryPoolResults returns ename:VK_SUCCESS and query results are
deposited in the buffer pointed to by pname:pData. If only some of the results are available,
fname:vkGetQueryPoolResults returns ename:VK_NOT_READY; in this case, if pname:flags contains
ename:VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT, partial results are deposited in the buffer pointed to by
pname:pData.  Upon failure, a descriptive error code is returned.
