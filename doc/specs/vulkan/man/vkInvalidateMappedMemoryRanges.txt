vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges(3)
=================================

Name
----
vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges - Invalidate ranges of mapped memory objects.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the logical device which owns the specified memory ranges.

pname:memoryRangeCount::
    Number of memory ranges described by pname:pMemoryRanges.

pname:pMemoryRanges::
    Memory ranges to invalidate.

Description
-----------

fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges invalidates a number of ranges of a number of mapped memory
objects. pname:device is the handle to the device that owns the memory objects referenced by
the call. pname:memoryRangeCount specifies the number of memory ranges to invalidate and pname:pMemoryRanges
is a pointer to an array of slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges
to be invalidated. The definition of slink:VkMappedMemoryRange is:

include::../structs/VkMappedMemoryRange.txt[]

The pname:sType member of each element of pname:pMemoryRanges should be set to ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MAPPED_MEMORY_RANGE.
The pname:memory member of the structure specifies the handle to the device memory object containing the
mapped region and pname:offset and pname:size specify the starting offset and size of the region, in bytes, respectively.
Areas of regions that extend outside the mapped portion of the parent memory object are ignored and
have no effect.

After invalidation, any data stored in the referenced region is discarded and should be considered
stale.
