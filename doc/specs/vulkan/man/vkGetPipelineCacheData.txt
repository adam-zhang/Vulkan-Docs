vkGetPipelineCacheData(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkGetPipelineCacheData - Get the data store from a pipeline cache

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetPipelineCacheData.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the device that is the parent of the pipeline cache.

pname:pipelineCache::
    The pipeline cache whose data will be returned.

pname:pDataSize::
    A pointer to a variable to receive the size (in bytes) of the data retrieved from the cache.

pname:pData::
    A pointer to memory where the cache's data will be stored.

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetPipelineCacheData fills the output buffer pname:pData with a copy of the data
store of a pipeline cache, as a step in the process of the application retrieving and saving
the cache data. pname:pDataSize points to a variable that, on entry, contains the size
of the data area pointed to by pname:pData. If pname:pData is code:NULL, then the initial
value of the variable addressed by pname:pDataSize is ignored and overwritten with the
size of the data that would be returned. Otherwise, it is used to determine the size of
data that may be written to pname:pData, which should be large enough to receive the
entire data blob.
