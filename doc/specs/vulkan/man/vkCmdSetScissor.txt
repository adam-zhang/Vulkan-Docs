vkCmdSetScissor(3)
==================

Name
----
vkCmdSetScissor - Set the dynamic scissor rectangles on a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetScissor.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:scissorCount::
    The number of scissor rectangles to update.

pname:pScissors::
    A pointer to an array of structures defining the new scissor rectangles.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetScissor sets the dynamic scissor state on the command buffer specified
in pname:commandBuffer. pname:scissorCount specifies the number of scissor rectangles
to update and pname;pScissors is pointer to an array of slink:VkRect2D structures
defining the new scissor rectangles. The definition of slink:VkRect2D is:

include::../structs/VkRect2D.txt[]

The pname:offset and pname:extent members of slink:VkRect2D specify the origin and
size of the scissor rectangle, respectively. The rectangles numbered zero through
pname:scissorCount are updated and any remaining scissor rectangles become undefined.

The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the origins and extents are taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change them using fname:vkCmdSetScissor results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current values of the scissor rectangle
origins and extents become undefined and must be set using a call to
fname:vkCmdSetScissor.
