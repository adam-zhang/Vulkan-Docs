VkMemoryOutputFlags(3)
======================

Name
----
VkMemoryOutputFlags - Memory output coherency control flags.

C Specification
---------------

include::../flags/VkMemoryOutputFlags.txt[]

Constants
---------

ename:VK_MEMORY_OUTPUT_HOST_WRITE_BIT::
    Controls output coherency of host writes. +
    Using this flag allows prior host writes to be visible to subsequent commands.

ename:VK_MEMORY_OUTPUT_SHADER_WRITE_BIT::
    Controls output coherency of shader writes. +
    Using this flag allows prior shader writes to be visible to subsequent commands. +
    May trigger the flushing of any device caches involved in shader writes.

ename:VK_MEMORY_OUTPUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    Controls output coherency of color attachment writes. +
    Using this flag allows prior color attachment writes to be visible to subsequent commands. +
    May trigger the flushing of any device caches involved in color attachment writes.

ename:VK_MEMORY_OUTPUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    Controls output coherency of depth/stencil attachment writes. +
    Using this flag allows prior depth/stencil attachment writes to be visible to subsequent commands. +
    May trigger the flushing of any device caches involved in depth/stencil attachment writes.

ename:VK_MEMORY_OUTPUT_TRANSFER_BIT::
    Controls output coherency of transfer operations. +
    Using this flag allows the result of prior transfer operations to be visible to subsequent commands. +
    May trigger the flushing of any device caches involved in the transfer operations.

Description
-----------

These flags are used in the slink:VkMemoryBarrier, slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier, and slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier structures
passed to the commands flink:vkCmdWaitEvents and flink:vkCmdPipelineBarrier.

The flags are always used in conjunction with a set of memory input coherency control flags that are defined in
elink:VkMemoryInputFlags.

Using these flags alone does not necessarily guarantee that the appropriate outputs are visible to inputs of
subsequent commands. In order to ensure that the outputs are visible on a particular input the corresponding
memory input coherency control flag should also be specified in the current or a future memory barrier structure.
