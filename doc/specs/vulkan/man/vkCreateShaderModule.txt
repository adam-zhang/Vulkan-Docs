vkCreateShaderModule(3)
========================

Name
----
vkCreateShaderModule - Creates a new shader module object.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCreateShaderModule.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device to own the new object.

pname:pCreateInfo::
    A pointer to a structure defining the shader module object to be created.

pname:pShaderModule::
    Pointer to the variable to receive a handle to the new object.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCreateShaderModule creates a new shader module from shader source provided by the caller.
pname:device is a handle to the device that is to be used to create the shader module. pname:pCreateInfo
is a pointer to an instance of the slink:VkShaderModuleCreateInfo structure which contains information
needed to construct the module. The definition of slink:VkShaderModuleCreateInfo is:

include::../structs/VkShaderModuleCreateInfo.txt[]

The pname:pCode member of pname:pCreateInfo contains a pointer to an opaque code structure describing
the content of the shader module. The pname:codeSize member specifies the length of the data pointed
to by pname:pCreateInfo in bytes. The pname:flags member of pname:pCreateInfo is used to further control
construction of the shader module. However, no flags are currently defined, pname:flags is therefore
reserved and should be set to zero.

Upon success, a handle to the newly created shader module object is placed in the variable that is pointed
to by pname:pShaderModule.
