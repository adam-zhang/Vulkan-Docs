vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties(3)
=================================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties - Retrieve properties of an image format applied to sparse images.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:physicalDevice::
    The physical device whose properties to query.

pname:format::
    The format about which to query the device.

pname:type::
    The dimensionality of the image.

pname:samples::
    The number of multisamples in the image.

pname:usage::
    The intended usages for the image.

pname:tiling::
    A set of flags defining the tiling of the image.

pname:pPropertyCount::
    A pointer to a variable that contains the number of properties to query.

pname:pProperties::
    A pointer to an array of slink:VkSparseImageFormatProperties structures that will receive the results of the query.

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties queries the physical device
specified in pname:physicalDevice for its support of the format described by
the remaining parameters to the command should that format be used with
a sparse image.

pname:format specifies the format of the image and is a member of the
elink:VkFormat enumeration. pname:type specifies the type of the image
and is a member of the elink:VkImageType enumeration, the definition of
which is:

include::../enums/VkImageType.txt[]

The pname:samples parameter specifies the number of samples to be used in
the image and must be a supported sample count for the image format. The
possible values are:

include::../enums/VkSampleCountFlagBits.txt[]

If pname:samples is ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT then the image is not multisampled.

The pname:usage parameter is a bitfield made up of members of the elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits
enumeration and specifies the intended usage for the image. The definition of
elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits is:

include::../enums/VkImageUsageFlagBits.txt[]

On input, pname:pPropertyCount points to a variable that is populated with
the number of aspects to query about the image. pname:pProperties is a pointer
to an array of at least this many slink:VkSparseImageFormatProperties
structures, the definition of which is:

include::../structs/VkSparseImageFormatProperties.txt[]

On return, the variable pointed to by pname:pPropertyCount will be overwritten
with the number of entries in pname:pProperties that were populated by the
command.

In the slink:VkSparseImageFormatProperties structure, pname:aspectMask contains
the aspects of the image to which this property applies. pname:imageGranularity
contains the size, in texels at which image memory is to be bound to a sparse
image with the specified properties through a call to flink:vkQueueBindSparse.
pname:flags contains a bitfield of the supported flags for this image format,
and is a bitwise combination of members of the elink:VkSparseImageFormatFlagBits
enumeration, the definition of which is:

include::../enums/VkSparseImageFormatFlagBits.txt[]

include::../validity/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties.txt[]

Return Value
------------

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties does not return a value.
However, on success, the variable pname:pPropertyCount is overwritten with
the number of structures written into the array pointed to by pname:pProperties.
On failure, the variable is overwritten with zero.
