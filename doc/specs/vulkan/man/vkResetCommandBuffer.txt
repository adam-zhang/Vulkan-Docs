=======================

Name
----
vkResetCommandBuffer - Reset a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkResetCommandBuffer.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    Command buffer to reset.

pname:flags::
    Flags controlling the behavior of the Reset operation. For more details,
    see elink:VkCommandBufferResetFlags.

Description
-----------

fname:vkResetCommandBuffer resets the command buffer specified in pname:commandBuffer to a
state where it can begin recording commands, i.e. it can be rebuilt by calling
fname:vkBeginCommandBuffer. Note that it is necessary to reset a command buffer
which encountered an error during build before it can be reused.

If pname:flags includes ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT, then most or
all memory resources currently owned by the command buffer should be returned to the
parent command pool. If this flag is not set, then the command buffer may hold onto
memory resources and reuse them when recording commands.
