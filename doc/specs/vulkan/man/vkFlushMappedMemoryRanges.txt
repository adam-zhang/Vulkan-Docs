vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges(3)
============================

Name
----
vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges - Flush mapped memory ranges.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the specified memory ranges.

pname:memoryRangeCount::
    Number of memory ranges described by pname:pMemoryRanges.

pname:pMemoryRanges::
    Mapped memory ranges to flush.

Description
-----------

fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges flushes zero more more ranges of a mapped memory objects. pname:device
is a handle to the device that owns the memory objects to be flushed. pname:memoryRangeCount is
the number of ranges to flush and pname:pMemoryRanges points to an array of pname:memoryRangeCount
instances of the slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structure, each defining a region of memory
to flush. The definition of slink:VkMappedMemoryRange is:

include::../structs/VkMappedMemoryRange.txt[]

For each element of the pname:pMemoryRanges array, pname:memory is the memory object containing
the mapped range, pname:offset is the location of the start of the range within pname:memory,
and pname:size is the size of the region to flush. Both pname:offset and pname:size are
specified in bytes.

If any referenced region of the memory object is not mapped or extends beyond the bounds of the memory
object then the command has no effect on that region, but is still honored for other regions in
the array. Multiple regions inside the same memory object may be contained in pname:pMemoryRanges,
including ranges that overlap one another.

Flushing memory ranges ensures that any writes performed by the host become visible to commands
subsequently executing on devices with references to that memory. fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges
has no effect with respect to writes performed by the device.
