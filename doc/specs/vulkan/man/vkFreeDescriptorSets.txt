vkFreeDescriptorSets(3)
=======================

Name
----
vkFreeDescriptorSets - Free one or more descriptor sets

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkFreeDescriptorSets.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    The device that owns the descriptor sets.

pname:descriptorPool::
    The descriptor pool that the descriptor sets were allocated from.

pname:descriptorSetCount::
    The number of descriptor sets to free.

pname:pDescriptorSets::
    An array of pname:descriptorSetCount variables containing the descriptor
    set handles to free.

Description
-----------

fname:vkFreeDescriptorSets frees descriptor sets. pname:device is a handle
to the device that owns the descriptor pool specified in
pname:descriptorPool, which must be the pool from which the sets were
allocated. Freeing a descriptor set returns its descriptors to the pool from
which it was allocated but does not necessarily free resources associated
with the set. pname:pDescriptorSets is a pointer to an array of descriptor
set handles returned from previous calls to flink:vkAllocateDescriptorSets.
pname:descriptorSetCount specifies the number of descriptor set handles in
the pname:pDescriptorSets array.

To actually free resources associated with descriptor pools, call flink:vkDestroyDescriptorPool.
