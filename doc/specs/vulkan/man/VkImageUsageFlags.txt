C Specification
---------------

include::../enums/VkImageUsageFlagBits.txt[]
include::../flags/VkImageUsageFlags.txt[]

Constants
---------

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT::
    The image can be used as the source operand of transfer operations (flink:vkCmdCopyImage,
    flink:vkCmdBlitImage, flink:vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer, flink:vkCmdResolveImage).

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT::
    The image can be used as the destination operand of transfer operations (flink:vkCmdCopyImage,
    flink:vkCmdBlitImage, flink:vkCmdCopyBufferToImage, flink:vkCmdClearColorImage,
    flink:vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage, flink:vkCmdResolveImage).

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT::
    The image supports filtered and/or unfiltered sampling via sampled image and combined image sampler
    descriptors.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT::
    The image supports loads, stores, and atomic operations via storage image descriptors.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    The image can be used as a framebuffer color attachment. +
    A framebuffer can only use an attachment view as a color attachment if the
    view's image was created with this usage flag.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    The image can be used as a framebuffer depth/stencil attachment. +
    A framebuffer can only use an attachment view as a depth/stencil attachment if the
    view's image was created with this usage flag.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    The contents of images created with this usage flag are only maintained within a render pass.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    The image can be used as a framebuffer input attachment.

Description
-----------

These flags are used in the slink:VkImageCreateInfo structure passed as parameter to flink:vkCreateImage
to define the intended use of the created image. Trying to use the image for any other purpose than
those requested at creation time may result in undefined behavior.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT and ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT are
exclusive. No image can be created with both of these flags being set.

ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT can only be used together with either the
ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT, the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, or
the ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT flags.
