====================

Name
----
vkCmdDrawIndexed - Issue an indexed draw into a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdDrawIndexed.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    Specifies the command buffer into which to insert the draw command.

pname:firstIndex::
    Specifies the first element from the index buffer to be consumed by the command.

pname:indexCount::
    Specifies the number of elements from the index buffer to be consumed by the command.

pname:vertexOffset::
    Specifies a constant offset to be added to the value retrieved from the index buffer.

pname:firstInstance::
    Specifies the starting value of the internally generated instance count.

pname:instanceCount::
    Specifies the number of instances of the geometry to consume.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDrawIndexed issues an indexed draw into a command bufer. The command
consumes pname:indexCount elements from the bound index buffer, starting from
pname:firstIndex, and inserts them into graphics pipeline. Before insertion to the
pipeline, pname:vertexOffset is added to each index value. pname:instanceCount instances
of the index buffer range are inserted into the pipeline. The first shader in
the pipeline is presented with the instance index, which begins at pname:firstInstance.

Notes
-----

Although fname:vkCmdDrawIndexed does not generate errors or return a value, enabled
validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
