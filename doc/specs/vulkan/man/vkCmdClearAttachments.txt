vkCmdClearAttachments(3)
========================

Name
----
vkCmdClearAttachments - Clear regions within currently bound framebuffer attachments.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdClearAttachments.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:attachmentCount::
    The number of attachments to clear.

pname:pAttachments::
    A pointer to an array of structures describing the attachments to clear
    and the values to clear them to.

pname:rectCount::
    The number of regions within the attachments to clear.

pname:pRects::
    A pointer to an array of rectangles defining the regions to clear.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdClearAttachments clears regions within the attachments associated
with the current renderpass. pname:commandBuffer is a handle to the command
buffer into which to insert the command. A renderpass must be active on
pname:commandBuffer. pname:attachmentCount specifies the number of attachments
to clear and pname:pAttachments is a pointer to an array of pname:attachmentCount
slink:VkClearAttachment structures, each containing the aspect(s), attachment
index and the clear value for each attachment. The definition of
slink:VkClearAttachment is:

include::../structs/VkClearAttachment.txt[]

pname:aspectMask is a bitfield specifying the aspect or aspects to clear
on the referenced attachment. It is constructed from a bitwise combination
of the members of the elink:VkImageAspectFlagBits enumeration, the
definition of which is:

include::../enums/VkImageAspectFlagBits.txt[]

The pname:colorAttachment member of slink:VkClearAttachment specifies the
index of the color attachment within the current framebuffer. The pname:clearValue
member contains the value to which to clear the attachment. It is an instance
of the slink:VkClearValue union, the definition of which is:

include::../structs/VkClearValue.txt[]

If the attachment and aspect referenced by ptext:aspectMask and
ptext:colorAttachment is a color attachment, the the values contained in the
pname:color field of slink:VkClearValue is used to clear the attachment
regions. If the attachment and aspect referenced by ptext:aspectMask and
ptext:colorAttachment is a depth, stencil or depth-stencil attachment, then
the pname:depthStencil field of slink:VkClearValue is used to clear the
attachment.

The pname:rectCount parameter to fname:vkCmdClearAttachments specifies the
number of regions of the attachments to clear. pname:pRects is a pointer
to an array of pname:rectCount slink:VkClearRect structures defining
those regions. The definition of slink:VkClearRect is:

include::../structs/VkClearRect.txt[]

The pname:rect member of slink:VkClearRect specifies the rectangle, measured
in pixels, of the rectangle to clear. pname:baseArrayLayer and
pname:layerCount specify the first layer and number of layers to clear
and should be used to clear multiple layers in layered attachments.
