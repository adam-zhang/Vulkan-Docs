C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyFence.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:fence::
    The handle of the object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyFence destroys the fence object whose handle is specified in
pname:fence. pname:fence must be a valid handle to fence object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateFence on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a fence object has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again. Results are undefined
if another thread is waiting on a fence when the fence is destroyed.
