vkCmdSetDepthBounds(3)
======================

Name
----
vkCmdSetDepthBounds - Set the depth bounds test values for a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetDepthBounds.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:minDepthBounds::
    The minimum value for the depth bounds test range.

pname:maxDepthBounds::
    The maximum value for the depth bounds test range.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetDepthBounds sets the minimum and maximum values for the depth bounds
test for the command buffer specified in pname:commandBuffer. pname:minDepthBounds and
pname:maxDepthBounds specify the minimum and maximum values for the depth bounds
test respectively. A the value stored in the current depth attachment at a fragment's
location lies between pname:minDepthBounds and pname:maxDepthBounds, then the depth
bounds test passes, otherwise the test fails and the fragment's coverage bit is
cleared.

The graphics pipeline bound to pname:commandBuffer must have the
ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the values of the depth bias parameters are taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change them using fname:vkCmdSetBlendConstants results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current values of the depth bias parameters become undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetDepthBias.

If the depth bounds test for the current pipeline is not enabled, then it is as
if the depth bounds test always passes and the values of pname:minDepthBounds
and pname:maxDepthBounds are ignored.

The value of pname:maxDepthBounds must be greater than or equal to the value of
pname:minDepthBounds.
