Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    Specifies the command buffer to which to bind the index buffer.

pname:buffer::
    The buffer object to bind.

pname:offset::
    The offset from the start of the buffer object where index data begins.

pname:indexType::
    The type of the index data stored in the buffer.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer binds the buffer object specified by pname:buffer, starting
at the byte offset specified in pname:offset as an index buffer on the graphics pipeline bind point
on pname:commandBuffer. pname:indexType specifies the type of the index data and must be one of
ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16 or ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32, to indicate 16- or 32-bit unsigned data, respectively.

If pname:indexType is ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16, then pname:offset must be a multiple of two. If pname:indexType
is ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32, then offset must be a multiple of four.
