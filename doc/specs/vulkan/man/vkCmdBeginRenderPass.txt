vkCmdBeginRenderPass(3)
========================

Name
----
vkCmdBeginRenderPass - Begin a new render pass.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdBeginRenderPass.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer in which to begin the render pass.

pname:pRenderPassBegin::
    A pointer to a structure describing how to begin the render pass.

pname:contents::
       A description of how the commands for the first subpass of the render pass
       will be issued.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass begins the first subpass of a new render pass in the command buffer specified by
pname:commandBuffer. Information about how to begin the render pass is given in an instance of
the slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure, a pointer to which is specified in pname:pRenderPassBegin.
The definition of slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo is:

include::../structs/VkRenderPassBeginInfo.txt[]

The pname:contents parameter describes how the commands in the first subpass will be
provided. If it is ename:VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_INLINE, the contents of the
subpass will be recorded inline in the primary command buffer, and calling a
secondary command buffer within the subpass is an error. If pname:contents
is ename:VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS, the contents are
recorded in secondary command buffers that will be called from the primary
command buffer, and fname:vkCmdExecuteCommands is the only valid command on
the command buffer until fname:vkCmdNextSubpass or fname:vkCmdEndRenderPass.

fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass is only allowed in primary command buffers. A render
pass must end in the same command buffer in which it was begun.

Notes
-----

Although fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass does not generate errors or return a value, enabled
validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
