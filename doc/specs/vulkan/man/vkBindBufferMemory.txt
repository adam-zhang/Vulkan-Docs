vkBindBufferMemory(3)
=====================

Name
----
vkBindBufferMemory - Bind device memory to a buffer object

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkBindBufferMemory.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the device that owns the object to which memory will be bound.

pname:buffer::
    A handle to the object to which to bind memory.

pname:memory::
    A handle to the device memory object.

pname:memoryOffset::
    The offset within the device memory object at which the binding should begin.

Description
-----------

fname:vkBindBufferMemory binds a region of the device memory object specified by pname:memory
to the resource buffer specified by pname:buffer. pname:buffer must be the handle of a buffer
resource.

pname:memoryOffset specifies the offset within pname:memory, in bytes, from which the binding
will begin. The value of pname:memoryOffset must satisfy the alignment requirments of the
object specified in pname:buffer. This value is returned in the ptext:alignment member of the
sname:VkMemoryRequirements retrieved by calling flink:vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements with with pname:buffer
as specified.

fname:vkBindBufferMemory should be used only for non-sparse resources. Memory is bound to sparse
buffers by calling flink:vkQueueBindSparse.
