========================

Name
----
VkAllocationCallbacks - Structure containing callback function pointers for memory allocation.

C Specification
---------------

include::../structs/VkAllocationCallbacks.txt[]

Fields
------

pname:pUserData::
    A pointer-sized variable that the sole use of the application.

pname:pfnAllocation::
    A pointer to a function that is called to allocate host memory.

pname:pfnReallocation::
    A pointer to a function that is called to resize an existing host memory allocation.

pname:pfnFree::
    A pointer to a function that is called to free an existing host memory allocation.

pname:pfnInternalAllocation::
    A pointer to a function that is called to make short-lived internal allocations.

pname:pfnInternalFree::
    A pointer to a function that is called to free internal allocations.

Description
-----------

This structure is contains pointers to callback functions that are used to create, reallocate
and free host memory allocations on behalf of a Vulkan implementation. The pname:pUserData
member of the structure is passed to each of the callback functions when they are called.
It is otherwise not accessed by the Vulkan implementation and its intended use is that the
host application use it to store state information related to memory allocation.
