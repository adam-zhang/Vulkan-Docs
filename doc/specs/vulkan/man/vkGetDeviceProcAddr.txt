vkGetDeviceProcAddr(3)
=======================

Name
----
vkGetDeviceProcAddr - Return a function pointer for a command

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkGetDeviceProcAddr.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    The VkDevice whose function pointer to query.

pname:pName::
    The name of the command.

Description
-----------

fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr returns a function pointer for the command specified
in pname:pName as it corresponds to pname:device. Depending on the operating
system, supporting components, software environment and hardware topology, the
function pointer returned for a single command name may be different for
different values of pname:device.

Device-specific function pointers only exist for commands that take a
device-child object as their first parameter. In the core API these are
sname:VkDevice, sname:VkQueue, and sname:VkCommandBuffer, though extensions may introduce additional dispatchable device-child object types. fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr will return code:NULL when pname:pName is not one of these commands.

Return Value
------------

Upon success, fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr returns a function pointer
(PFN_vkVoidFunction) for the command specified in pname:pName. If
pname:pName is not supported by the device or has no corresponding
pname:device, then fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr returns code:NULL.
