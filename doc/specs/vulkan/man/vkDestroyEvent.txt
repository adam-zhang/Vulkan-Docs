C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyEvent.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:event::
    The handle of the object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyEvent destroys the event object whose handle is specified in
pname:event. pname:event must be a valid handle to event object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateEvent on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a event object has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again. Results are undefined
if a command buffer is waiting on a event when the event is destroyed.
