C Specification

include::../protos/vkDestroyPipeline.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:pipeline::
    The handle of the object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyPipeline destroys the pipeline object whose handle is specified
in pname:pipeline. pname:pipeline must be a valid handle to a pipeline created through
a successful call to flink:vkCreateGraphicsPipelines or flink:vkCreateComputePipelines
on pname:device. Attempts to destroy code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored.
Once a pipeline has been destroyed, its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed
again.
