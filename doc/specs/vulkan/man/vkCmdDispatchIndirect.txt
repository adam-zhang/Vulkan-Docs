vkCmdDispatchIndirect(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkCmdDispatchIndirect - Dispatch compute work items using indirect parameters.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdDispatchIndirect.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    Command buffer upon which to execute the command.

pname:buffer::
    The buffer object containing the parameters to dispatch.

pname:offset::
    The offset within pname:buffer at which the parameters are located.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDispatchIndirect dispatches a group of ptext:x by ptext:y by ptext:z compute workgroups
where the values of ptext:x, ptext:y, and ptext:z are taken from pname:offset bytes into the
buffer object specified by pname:buffer. At this location in the buffer, there is assumed
to be an instance of the slink:VkDispatchIndirectCommand structure, whose definition is:

include::../structs/VkDispatchIndirectCommand.txt[]

pname:offset must be a multiple of four. If any of the pname:x, pname:y or pname:z members of
slink:VkDispatchIndirectCommand are zero, then no work is initiated. Two- and one-dimensional
work may be initiated by setting pname:z or pname:y and pname:z to 1, respectively.

Notes
-----

Although fname:vkCmdDispatchIndirect does not generate errors or return a value, enabled
validation layers may detect possible error conditions or potentially undefined
behavior and report this via some other means.
