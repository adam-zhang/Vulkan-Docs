vkCmdBindVertexBuffers(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkCmdBindVertexBuffers - Bind vertex buffers to a command buffer

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdBindVertexBuffers.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The first parameter.

pname:startBinding::
    The index of the first vertex buffer binding to which to bind a vertex buffer.

pname:bindingCount::
    The number of consecutive vertex buffer bindings to update.

pname:pBuffers::
    A pointer to an array of sname:VkBuffer handles representing the buffers to be bound.

pname:pOffsets::
    A pointer to an array of basetype:VkDeviceSize values containing the offsets, in bytes, of each binding within its respective buffer.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdBindVertexBuffers binds one or more vertex buffers to the command
buffer specified by pname:commandBuffer. The first binding to update is specified
in pname:startBinding and the number of bindings to update is specified in
pname:bindingCount.

pname:pBuffers points to an array of pname:bindingCount buffer object handles
representing the buffers to bind. The same buffer may be referenced multiple
times. pname:pOffsets points to an array of pname:bindingCount values containing
the offsets, in bytes of the start of each binding within the current buffer.

Vertex data consumed by drawing commands such as flink:vkCmdDraw
or flink:vkCmdDrawIndexed subsequently issued in pname:commandBuffer is drawn
from the buffers bound to that command buffer.
