vkCmdSetLineWidth(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdSetLineWidth - Set the dynamic line width state.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetLineWidth.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:lineWidth::
    The new line width.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetLineWidth sets the dymamic line width for the command buffer specified
in pname:commandBuffer to the value specified in pname:lineWidth. Line primitives drawn
subsequent to this command, either directly using line topologies or by generation of
line primitives mid-pipeline, will assume the specified width.

Dynamic line width may be modified only if the current pipeline state object was created
with the ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the line width is taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change it using fname:vkCmdSetLineWidth results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current value for line width becomes undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetLineWidth.
