include::../protos/vkFreeCommandBuffers.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the device that owns the command pool and command buffers referenced by the command.

pname:commandPool::
    A handle to the command pool which owns the command buffers.

pname:commandBufferCount::
    The number of command buffers to free.

pname:pCommandBuffers::
    A pointer to an array of handles to the command buffers to free.

Description
-----------

fname:vkFreeCommandBuffers frees pname:commandBufferCount command buffers, returning their
resources to the pool specified in pname:commandPool. pname:pCommandBuffers is a pointer to an
array of pname:commandBufferCount basetype:VkCommandBuffer handles to the command buffers
to free. Each command buffer in the array must have been allocated from the pool specified
in pname:commandPool through a call to flink:vkAllocateCommandBuffers. pname:device must be a
handle to the device that owns both pname:commandPool and all of the command buffers referenced
from the array pointed to by pname:pCommandBuffers.

After command buffers are freed, they may not be referenced again. A command buffer must not
be freed while it is in flight.
