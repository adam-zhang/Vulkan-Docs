include::../protos/vkBindImageMemory.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    A handle to the device that owns the object to which memory will be bound.

pname:image::
    A handle to the object to which to bind memory.

pname:memory::
    A handle to the device memory object.

pname:memoryOffset::
    The offset within the device memory object at which the binding should begin.

Description
-----------

fname:vkBindImageMemory binds a region of the device memory object specified by pname:memory
to the resource image specified by pname:image. pname:image must be the handle of an image
resource.

pname:memoryOffset specifies the offset within pname:memory, in bytes, from which the binding
will begin. The value of pname:memoryOffset must satisfy the alignment requirments of the
image specified in pname:image. This value is returned in the ptext:alignment member of the
sname:VkMemoryRequirements retrieved by calling flink:vkGetImageMemoryRequirements with with pname:image
as specified.

fname:vkBindImageMemory should be used only for non-sparse resources. Memory
is bound to sparse imagesby calling flink:vkQueueBindSparse.
