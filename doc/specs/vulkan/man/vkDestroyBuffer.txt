vkDestroyBuffer(3)
==================

Name
----
vkDestroyBuffer - Destroy a buffer object

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyBuffer.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:buffer::
    The handle of the buffer object to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyBuffer destroys the buffer object whose handle is specified in
pname:buffer. pname:buffer must be a valid handle to buffer object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateBuffer on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a buffer object has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again. Furthermore, any views
of the buffer previously created through calls to flink:vkCreateBufferView on
the specified buffer also become invalid and should be destroyed before
the parent buffer.
