VK_QUERY_RESULT_32_BIT::
    When this flag is used the results of the queries are written to the destination buffer as one or more
    32-bit values.

VK_QUERY_RESULT_64_BIT::
    When this flag is used the results of the queries are written to the destination buffer as one or more
    64-bit values.

    When this flag is used the results of the queries aren't waited on before proceeding with the result copy.

VK_QUERY_RESULT_WAIT_BIT::
    When this flag is used the results of the queries are waited on before proceeding with the result copy.

VK_QUERY_RESULT_WITH_AVAILABILITY_BIT::
    When this flag is used the availability of the results is also written to the destination buffer as a
    separate value after the actual results. If the results of the query were available at the time of the
    result copy the integer value 1 is written, otherwise the integer value 0 is written to the destination buffer.

VK_QUERY_RESULT_PARTIAL_BIT::
    When this flag is used the partial results of the queries are written to the destination buffer even if the
    final results aren't available. If this flag isn't used then the locations in the destination buffer
    corresponding to result values of queries whose result isn't available at the time of the result copy will
    be left untouched.
