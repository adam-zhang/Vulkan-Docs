vkCmdSetBlendConstants.txt(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkCmdSetBlendConstants - Set the values of blend constants.

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdSetBlendConstants.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which to insert the command.

pname:blendConstants::
    An array of values specifying the new blend constants.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdSetBlendConstants sets the blend constants for the command buffer specified
by pname:commandBuffer to the values specified in the four element array pname:blendConstants.
Blend constants may be modified only if the current pipeline state object was created
with the ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS dynamic state enabled. When a pipeline
that does not have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS dynamic state enabled is
first bound, the values of the blend constants are taken from the pipeline and
attempts to change them using fname:vkCmdSetBlendConstants results in undefined
behavior. When a pipeline does have ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS dynamic
state enabled is first bound, the current values of the blend constants become undefined
and must be set using a call to fname:vkCmdSetBlendConstants.
