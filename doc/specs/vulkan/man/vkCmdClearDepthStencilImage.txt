C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:commandBuffer::
    The command buffer into which the command is to be placed.

pname:image::
    The image containing the regions to be cleared.

pname:imageLayout::
    The layout of the image to be cleared.

pname:pDepthStencil::
    A pointer to a structure containing the values to clear the image with.

pname:rangeCount::
    The number of image regions to clear.

pname:pRanges::
    A pointer to an array of pname:rangeCount regions to clear.

Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage clears pname:rangeCount regions of a combined
depth-stencil image to the values specified in the structure whose address is
given in pname:pDepthStencil. This is a pointer to an instance of the
slink:VkClearDepthStencilValue structure, the definition of which is:

include::../structs/VkClearDepthStencilValue.txt[]

The pname:depth and pname:stencil members contain the value to clear the the
depth and stencil aspects of the image to, respectively. pname:imageLayout
specifies the layout of the image being cleared. pname:pRanges points to an
array pname:rangeCount regions of the image are cleared, each of which is described
by an instance of the slink:VkImageSubresourceRange structure, the definition
of which is:
