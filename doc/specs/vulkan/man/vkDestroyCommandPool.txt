vkDestroyCommandPool(3)
=======================

Name
----
vkDestroyCommandPool - Destroy a command pool object

C Specification
---------------

include::../protos/vkDestroyCommandPool.txt[]

Parameters
----------

pname:device::
    Logical device which owns the object.

pname:commandPool::
    The command pool to destroy.

Description
-----------

fname:vkDestroyCommandPool destroys the command pool object whose handle is specified in
pname:commandPool. pname:commandPool must be a valid handle to command object created
through a successful call to flink:vkCreateCommandPool on pname:device. Attempts to destroy
code:VK_NULL_HANDLE are silently ignored. After a command pool object has been destroyed,
its handle becomes invalid and must not be accessed again. Any command buffers allocated from
the pool also become invalid and must not be accessed.

All command buffers allocated from the pool must be freed by a call to flink:vkFreeCommandBuffers before the pool
is destroyed. Failure to return command buffers to their command pools before destroying
the pool object may result in resource leaks.
