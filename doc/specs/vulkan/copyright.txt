Khronos Group grants express permission to any current Promoter, Contributor
or Adopter member of Khronos to copy and redistribute UNMODIFIED versions
of this specification in any fashion, provided that NO CHARGE is made for the
specification and the latest available update of the specification for any version
of the API is used whenever possible. Such distributed specification may be reformatted

This specification has been created under the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy,
which is Attachment A of the Khronos Group Membership Agreement available at 
www.khronos.org/files/member_agreement.pdf. This specification contains substantially 
unmodified functionality from, and is a successor to, Khronos specifications including 
OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenCL.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and do not define requirements 
necessary for compliance and so are outside the Scope of this Specification.  These 
parts of the Specification are marked by the “Note” icon or designated “Informative”.

Where this Specification uses terms, defined in the Glossary or otherwise, that refer to 
enabling technologies that are not expressly set forth as being required for compliance, 
those enabling technologies are outside the Scope of this Specification.

Where this Specification uses the terms “may”, or “optional”, such features or 
behaviors do not define requirements necessary for compliance and so are outside the 
Scope of this Specification.

Where this Specification uses the terms “not required”, such features or 
behaviors may be omitted from certain implementations, but when they are included, they
define requirements necessary for compliance and so are INCLUDED in the Scope of this 
Specification.

Where this Specification includes normative references to external documents, the 
specifically identified sections and functionality of those external documents are in 
Scope. Requirements defined by external documents not created by Khronos may contain 
contributions from non-members of Khronos not covered by the Khronos Intellectual 
Property Rights Policy.
