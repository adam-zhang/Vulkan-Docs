* If pname:flags contains the ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag, and pname:basePipelineHandle is not sname:VK_NULL_HANDLE, pname:basePipelineIndex must: be `-1`
* If pname:flags contains the ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag, and pname:basePipelineHandle is not sname:VK_NULL_HANDLE, pname:basePipelineHandle must: be a valid sname:VkPipeline handle
* If pname:flags contains the ename:VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT flag, and pname:basePipelineHandle is not sname:VK_NULL_HANDLE, it must: be a valid handle to a compute sname:VkPipeline
* The pname:stage member of pname:stage must: be ename:VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT
