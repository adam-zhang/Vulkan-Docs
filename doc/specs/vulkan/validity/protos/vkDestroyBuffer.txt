* pname:device must: be a valid sname:VkDevice handle
* If pname:buffer is not sname:VK_NULL_HANDLE, pname:buffer must: be a valid sname:VkBuffer handle
* If pname:pAllocator is not `NULL`, pname:pAllocator must: be a pointer to a valid sname:VkAllocationCallbacks structure
* If pname:buffer is a valid handle, it must: have been created, allocated or retrieved from pname:device
* Each of pname:device and pname:buffer that are valid handles must: have been created, allocated or retrieved from the same sname:VkPhysicalDevice
* All submitted commands that refer to pname:buffer, either directly or via a sname:VkBufferView, must: have completed execution
* If sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:buffer was created, a compatible set of callbacks must: be provided here
* If no sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:buffer was created, pname:pAllocator must: be `NULL`
