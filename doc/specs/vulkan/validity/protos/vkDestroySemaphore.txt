* pname:semaphore mustnot: be associated with any queue command that has not yet completed execution on that queue
* If sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:semaphore was created, a compatible set of callbacks must: be provided here
* If no sname:VkAllocationCallbacks were provided when pname:semaphore was created, pname:pAllocator must: be `NULL`
