The VK_KHR_win32_surface extension is an instance extension.  It provides a
mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by the
VK_KHR_surface extension) that refers to a Win32 HWND, as well as a query
to determine support for rendering to the windows desktop.

=== Issues

1) Does Win32 need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
   physical device and a specific screen?  Compatibility between a physical
   device and a window generally only depends on what screen the window is on.
   However, there isn't an obvious way to identify a screen without already
   having a window on the screen.

   RESOLVED: No. While it may be useful, there isn't a clear way to do this on
   Win32.  However, a method was added to query support for presenting to the
   windows desktop as a whole.
