=== Issues

1)  Which properties of a mode should be fixed in the mode info Vs.
    settable in some other function when setting the mode?  E.g., do
    we need to double the size of the mode pool to include both stereo
    and non-stereo modes?  YUV and RGB scannout even if they both take
    RGB input images?   BGR Vs. RGB input?   etc.

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Many modern displays support at most
    a handful of resolutions and timings natively.  Other "modes" are
    expected to be supported using scaling hardware on the display engine
    or GPU.  Other properties, such as rotation and mirroring shouldn't
    require duplicating hardware modes just to express all combinations.
    Further, these properties may be implemented on a per-display or per-
    overlay granularity.

    To avoid the exponential growth of modes as mutable properties are
    added, as was the case with EGLConfig/WGL pixel formats/GLXFBConfig,
    this specificaiton should separate out hardware properties and
    configurable state into separate objects.  Modes and overlay planes
    will express capabilities of the hardware, while a separate structure
    will allow applications to configure scaling, rotation, mirroring,
    color keys, LUT values, alpha masks, etc. for a given swapchain
    independent of the mode in use.  Constraints on these settings will
    be established by properties of the immutable objects.

    Note the resolution of this issue may affect issue (5) as well.

2)  What properties of a display itself are useful?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: This issue is too broad.  It was meant to
    prompt general discussion, but resolving this issue amounts to
    completing this specification.  All interesting properties should
    be included.  The issue will remain as a placeholder since
    removing it would make it hard to parse existing discussion notes
    that refer to issues by number.

3)  How are multiple overlay planes within a display or mode enumerated?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: They are refered to by an index.  Each display
    will report the number of overlay planes it contains.

4)  Should swapchains be created relative to a mode or a display?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: When using this extension, swapchains are
    created relative to a mode and a plane.  The mode implies the display
    object the swapchain will present to.  If the specified mode is not
    the display's current mode, the new mode will be applied when the
    first image is presented to the swapchain, and the default operating
    system mode, if any, will be restored when the swapchain is destroyed.

5)  Should users query generic ranges from displays and construct
    their own modes explicitly using those constraints rather than
    querying a fixed set of modes (Most monitors only have one real
    "mode" these days, even though many support relatively arbitrary
    scaling, either on the monitor side or in the GPU display engine,
    making "modes" something of a relic/compatibility construct).

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Expose both.  Display info structures will
    expose a set of predefined modes, as well as any attributes
    necessary to construct a customized mode.

6)  Is it fine if we return the display and display mode handles in the
    structure used to query their properties?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Yes.

7)  Is there a possibility that not all displays of a device work with
    all of the present queues of a device? If yes, how do we determine
    which displays work with which present queues?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: No known hardware has such limitations, but
    determing such limitations is supported automatically using the
    existing VK_EXT_KHR_surface and VK_EXT_KHR_swapchain query mechanisms.

8)  Should all presentation need to be done relative to an overlay plane,
    or can a display mode + display be used alone to target an output?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Require specifying a plane explicitly.

9)  Should displays have an associated window system display, such as an
    HDC or Display*?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: No.  Displays are independent of any windowing
    system in use on the system.  Further, neither HDC nor Display* refer
    to a physical display object.

10) Are displays queried from a physical GPU or from a device instance?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Developers prefer to query modes directly from
    the physical GPU so they can use display information as an input
    to their device selection algorithms prior to device creation.  This
    avoids the need to create dummy device instances to enumerate
    displays.

    This preference must be weighed against the extra initializaiton
    that must be done by driver vendors prior to device instance
    creation to support this usage.

11) Should displays and/or modes be dispatchable objects?
    If functions are to take displays, overlays, or modes as their
    first parameter, they must be dispatchable objects as defined
    in Khronos bug 13529.  If they aren't added to the list of
    dispatchable objects, functions operating on them must take some
    higher-level object as their first parameter.  There is no
    performance case against making them dispatchable objects, but
    they would be the first extension objects to be dispatchable.

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Do not make displays or modes dispatchable.
    They will dispatch based on their associated physical device.

12) Should hardware cursor capabilities be exposed?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Defer.  This could be a separate extension on
    top of the base WSI specs.


    if they are one physical display device to an end user, but may
    internally be implemented as two side-by-side displays using the
    same display engine (and sometimes cabling) resources as two
    physically separate display devices.

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Tiled displays will appear as a single display
    object in this API.

14) Should the raw EDID data be included in the display information?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: None.  Unclear whether this is a good idea.
    Provides a path for forward-compatibility as new EDID extensions
    are introduced, but may be complicated by the outcome of issue 13.

15) Should min and max scaling factor capabilities of overlays be
    exposed?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Yes.  This is exposed indirectly by allowing
    applications to query the min/max position and extent of the source
    and destination regions from which image contents are fetched by
    the display engine when using a particular mode and overlay pair.

16) Should devices be able to expose planes that can be moved between
    displays?  If so, how?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: None.

17) Should there be a way to destroy display modes?  If so, does it
    support destroying "built in" modes?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: None.

18) What should the lifetime of display and built-in display mode objects
    be?

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: The lifetime of the instance.  These objects can
    not be destroyed.  A future extension may be added to expose a way to
    destroy these objects and/or support display hotplug.

19) Should persistent mode for smart panels be enabled/disabled at swap
    chain creation time, or on a per-present basis.

    PROPOSED RESOLUTION: On a per-present basis.

----------------------------------------

=== Version History

 * Revision 1, 2015-02-24 (James Jones)
   - Initial draft

 * Revision 2, 2015-03-12 (Norbert Nopper)
   - Added overlay enumeration for a display.

 * Revision 3, 2015-03-17 (Norbert Nopper)
   - Fixed typos and namings as discussed in Bugzilla.
   - Reordered and grouped functions.
   - Added functions to query count of display, mode and overlay.
   - Added native display handle, which is maybe needed on some platforms to create a native Window.

 * Revision 4, 2015-03-18 (Norbert Nopper)
   - Removed primary and virtualPostion members (see comment of James Jones in Bugzilla).
   - Added native overlay handle to info structure.
   - Replaced , with ; in struct.

 * Revision 6, 2015-03-18 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Added WSI extension suffix to all items.
   - Made the whole API more "Vulkanish".
   - Replaced all functions with a single vkGetDisplayInfoKHR function to better match the rest of the API.
   - Made the display, display mode, and overlay objects be first class objects, not subclasses of VkBaseObject as they don't support the common functions anyways.
   - Renamed *Info structures to *Properties.
   - Removed overlayIndex field from VkOverlayProperties as there is an implicit index already as a result of moving to a "Vulkanish" API.
   - Displays aren't get through device, but through physical GPU to match the rest of the Vulkan API. Also this is something ISVs explicitly requested.
   - Added issue (6) and (7).

 * Revision 7, 2015-03-25 (James Jones)
   - Added an issues section
   - Added rotation and mirroring flags

 * Revision 8, 2015-03-25 (James Jones)
   - Combined the duplicate issues sections introduced in last change.
   - Added proposed resolutions to several issues.

 * Revision 9, 2015-04-01 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Rebased extension against Vulkan 0.82.0

 * Revision 10, 2015-04-01 (James Jones)
   - Added issues (10) and (11).
   - Added more straw-man issue resolutions, and cleaned up the
     proposed resolution for issue (4).
   - Updated the rotation and mirroring enums to have proper bitfield
     semantics.

 * Revision 11, 2015-04-15 (James Jones)
   - Added proposed resolution for issues (1) and (2).
   - Added issues (12), (13), (14), and (15)
   - Removed pNativeHandle field from overlay structure.
   - Fixed small compilation errors in example code.

 * Revision 12, 2015-07-29 (James Jones)
   - Rewrote the guts of the extension against the latest WSI swapchain
     specifications and the latest Vulkan API.
   - Address overlay planes by their index rather than an object handle
     and refer to them as "planes" rather than "overlays" to make it
     slightly clearer that even a display with no "overlays" still has at
     least one base "plane" that images can be displayed on.
   - Updated most of the issues.
   - Added an "extension type" section to the specification header.
   - Re-used the VK_EXT_KHR_surface surface transform enumerations rather
     than redefining them here.
   - Updated the example code to use the new semantics.

 * Revision 13, 2015-08-21 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed this extension and all of its enumerations, types, functions,
     etc.  This makes it compliant with the proposed standard for Vulkan
     extensions.
   - Switched from "revision" to "version", including use of the
     VK_MAKE_VERSION macro in the header file.

 * Revision 14, 2015-09-01 (James Jones)
   - Restore single-field revision number.

 * Revision 15, 2015-09-08 (James Jones)
   - Added alpha flags enum.
   - Added premultiplied alpha support.

 * Revision 16, 2015-09-08 (James Jones)
   - Added description section to the spec.
   - Added issues 16 - 18.

 * Revision 17, 2015-10-02 (James Jones)
   - Planes are now a property of the entire device rather than individual
     displays.  This allows planes to be moved between multiple displays
     on devices that support it.
   - Added a function to create a VkSurfaceKHR object describing a display
     plane and mode to align with the new per-platform surface creation
     conventions.
   - Removed detailed mode timing data.  It was agreed that the mode
     extents and refresh rate are sufficient for current use cases.  Other
     information could be added back2 in as an extension if it is needed in
     the future.
   - Added support for smart/persistent/buffered display devices.

 * Revision 18, 2015-10-26 (Ian Elliott)
   - Renamed from VK_EXT_KHR_display to VK_KHR_display.

 * Revision 19, 2015-11-02 (James Jones)
   - Updataed example code to match revision 17 changes.

 * Revision 20, 2015-11-03 (Daniel Rakos)
   - Added allocation callbacks to creation functions.

 * Revision 21, 2015-11-10 (Jesse Hall)
   - Added VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR, and use
     VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR for VkDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR::alphaMode
     instead of VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagsKHR, since it only represents one mode.
   - Added reserved flags bitfield to VkDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR.
   - Use VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR instead of obsolete
     VkSurfaceTransformKHR.
   - Renamed vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR parameters for clarity.

 * Revision 22, 2015-12-18 (James Jones)
   - Added missing "planeIndex" parameter to
     vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR()
