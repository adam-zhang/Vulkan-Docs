The VK_KHR_mir_surface extension is an instance extension.  It provides a
mechanism to create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object (defined by the
VK_KHR_surface extension) that refers to a Mir surface, as well as a query
to determine support for rendering to the windows desktop.

=== New Object Types

None

=== New Enum Constants

  * Extending ename:VkStructureType:
  ** ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MIR_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR

=== New Enums

None

=== New Structures

  * slink:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR

=== New Functions

  * flink:vkCreateMirSurfaceKHR
  * flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceMirPresentationSupportKHR

=== Issues

1) Does Mir need a way to query for compatibility between a particular
   physical device (and queue family?) and a specific Mir connection, screen,
   window, etc.?

   RESOLVED: Yes, vkGetPhysicalDeviceMirPresentationSupportKHR() was added to
   address this.

=== Version History
