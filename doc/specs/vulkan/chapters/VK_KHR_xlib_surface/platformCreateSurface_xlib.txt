=== Xlib Platform

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for an X11 window, using the Xlib
client-side library, call:

include::../../protos/vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing the parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The definition of sname:VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR is:

include::../../structs/VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

The members of sname:VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR have the following
meanings:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_XLIB_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:dpy is a pointer to an Xlib Display connection to the X server.
  * pname:window is an Xlib Window to associate the surface with.

include::../../validity/structs/VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

With Xlib, pname:minImageExtent, pname:maxImageExtent, and pname:currentExtent
are the window size.  Therefore, a swapchain's pname:imageExtent must: match the
window's size.

Some :apiname: functions may: send protocol over the specified Xlib Display
connection when using a swapchain or presentable images created from a VkSurface
referring to an Xlib window.  Applications must: therefore ensure the display
connection is available to :apiname: for the duration of any functions that
manipulate such swapchains or their presentable images, and any functions that
build or queue command buffers that operate on such presentable images.
Specifically, applications using :apiname: with Xlib-based swapchains must:

  * Call XInitThreads() before calling any other Xlib functions if they intend
    to use :apiname: in multiple threads, or use :apiname: and Xlib in separate
    threads.
  * Avoid holding a server grab on a display connection while waiting for
    :apiname: operations to complete using a swapchain derived from a different
    display connection referring to the same X server instance.  Failing to do
    so may: result in deadlock.
