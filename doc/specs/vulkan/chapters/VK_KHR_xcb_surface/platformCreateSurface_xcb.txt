=== XCB Platform

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for an X11 window, using the XCB
client-side library, call:

include::../../protos/vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The definition of sname:VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR is:

include::../../structs/VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

The members of sname:VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR have the following
meanings:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_XCB_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:connection is a pointer to an xcb_connection_t to the X server.
  * pname:window is the xcb_window_t for the X11 window to associate the
    surface with.

With Xcb, pname:minImageExtent, pname:maxImageExtent, and pname:currentExtent
are the window size.  Therefore, a swapchain's pname:imageExtent must: match the
window's size.

Some :apiname: functions may: send protocol over the specified xcb connection
when using a swapchain or presentable images created from a VkSurface referring
to an xcb window.  Applications must: therefore ensure the xcb connection is
available to :apiname: for the duration of any functions that manipulate such
swapchains or their presentable images, and any functions that build or queue
command buffers that operate on such presentable images.  Specifically,
applications using :apiname: with xcb-based swapchains must:

  * Avoid holding a server grab on an xcb connection while waiting for :apiname:
    operations to complete using a swapchain derived from a different xcb
    connection referring to the same X server instance.  Failing to do
    so may: result in deadlock.
