=== Mir Platform

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a Mir window, call:

include::../../protos/vkCreateMirSurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

The definition of sname:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR is:

include::../../structs/VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

The members of sname:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR have the following
meanings:

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MIR_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:connection and pname:surface are pointers to the MirConnection and
    MirSurface for the window to associate the surface with.

include::../../validity/structs/VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

On Mir, when a swapchain's pname:imageExtent does not match the surface's
pname:currentExtent, the swapchain images will be scaled to the surface's
dimensions during presentation.  pname:minImageExtent is latexmath:[$(1, 1)$],
and pname:maxImageExtent is the maximum supported surface size.
